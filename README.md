# Data Analytics Power BI project

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a detailed and comprehensive quarterly report for a medium-sized international retailer client. The project involves utilising the analysis and design capabilites of Microsoft Power BI to extract and transform data from diverse sources, design a powerful data model rooted in a star-based schema and construct a multi-page report that caters to the specific needs of C-suite executives.

The report will include the following componants:
- A high-level executive business summary
- Insights into the highest value customers segmented by sales region
- A detailed analysis of top-performing products categorised by type against their sales targets
- A visually appealing map visual that spotlights the performance metrics of their retail outlets across different territories

This project uses guidelines and a template given by AiCore designed to develop key data analytical and visualisation skills. It is split into ten milestones to make it readable and manageable for a beginner to follow.

## Milestone 2: Import the data into Power BI

This milestone consists of data loading, preparation and transformation.
Four tables are imported into Power BI via different methods:
- The 'Orders' table is imported through an Azure SQL Database and null or missing values are identified and removed
- The 'Products' table is imported as a .csv file and duplicates removed
- The 'Stores' table is imported via connection to Azure Blob Storage
- The 'Customers' table is imported as combined files from a folder, unused columns are deleted and new columns created.
All the columns in the dataset are renamed to match Power BI naming conventions, ensuring a consistent and clear presentation.
